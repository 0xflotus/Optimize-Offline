## Build 3.1.2.8 ##

- Added a -Win32Calc switch that will now control whether the traditional Calculator gets applied or not, as opposed to having it automatically apply if the UWP Calculator is found to be removed. This allows full control for those who want either no calculator or both the UWP Calculator and the traditional Calculator.
- Made a small update to the Win32Calc process.
