# ChangeLog #

## Build 3.1.2.9 ##

- Updated multiple helper functions.
- Updated Microsoft Store and Dependency Packages.
- Created a new helper function, with a small C# wrapper, to detect whether a system is running on UEFI firmware.
- Optimize-Offline now checks whether the running system is UEFI. If a system is NOT detected as UEFI, the string data adding the UEFI Firmware icon, and its associated custom link, will be omitted from the custom Start Menu and Taskbar Layout and link creation object process.
- Using the -Features switch will now also display all disabled Windows Features in a Gridview list where they can be enabled.
- The -Registry parameter no longer has "Default" automatically set as a value and must be explicitly entered (like other parameters) when calling Optimize-Offline.
- Fixed two areas in the SetupComplete here-string that included duplicate closing brackets.
- Added a -NoISO switch that will prevent the automatic creation of a bootable Windows Installation ISO when Windows Installation Media is used as the source image.
- Other minor code adjustments.
