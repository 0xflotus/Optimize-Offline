## Version 3.0.3 ##

Minor processing adjustments have been made to clean-up some redundant or unnecessary code.

Improved the validity script for resolvable paths to ensure they meet the criteria required for the script to successfully run.

Added more detailed notes to further detail exactly what certain advanced functions and/or processes are doing.

Improved the Additional-Features function script in how it detected path types, added a few additional context menu additions and optimized some of the code that it generates for certain switches.

Cleaned up the help files and parameter/switch notes and information.

Changed the -AddFeatures switch to -AdditionalFeatures, as some were assuming the former switch was for adding features much like the -RemoveFeatures switch removes them.

## Version 3.0 ##

Version 3.0 has been released and includes some significant updates, changes and modifications.

The Helper-Script.ps1 has been removed.

There's a new function that allows for ownership of registry keys and subkeys to be granted to the BUILTIN\Administrator account, using Access Token privileges.

There are additional services and drivers disabled through the offline registry hives.

There are additional notes with some pertinent information regarding Provisioning Application Packages and Systep Applications.

Re-wrote the process where System Applications are "de-provisioned" and removed.

Added additional security registry settings.

The Additional-Features function script has been almost entirely re-written.

Now values are applied directly to the offline registry hives as opposed to using "REGEDIT /S" via OOBE.cmd

OOBE.cmd is now omitted, as it's no longer required with the elevated registry function.

The Windows 10 Enterprise LTSB 2016 Calculator (Win32Calc) is now able to be applied to the image. This is valuable if the regular calculator Provisioning Application Package is removed yet one still wants a built-in calculator.

A -SysPrep switch has been added that will auto-boot the image into Audit System for System Preparation.

A -GenuineTicket switch has been added that will apply a GenuineTicket.xml to the image for automatic activation upon installation.

And -Unattend switch has been added that will apply a custom unattend.xml to the image.

Generated scripts have been tweaked and modified to omit versions of Windows prior to Windows 10.

There's additional checking to ensure the build being optimized is supported (currently, there's no support for Insider Updates).
