## 3.0.4 ##

The registry tweaks have been rewritten to use PowerShell's native cmdlet, as well as a small function I made to create the required keys.

A -Local switch has been added which will use the root path of the script ($PSScriptRoot) as the location it will mount and save the images to.

This switch was added for those who do not want to use a primary SSD and would rather use a secondary HDD.

Be warned that meddling in any of the temporary directories while the script is processing will likely corrupt the image, so it's best to leave them alone.

The Additional-Features function parameters were changed from a string to a hashtable for easier on/off switching.

The help information was cleaned up and more was included to detail what the functions do.

Additional registry tweaks were added for performance and speed; likewise, a few more security-related values were also added.

I am implementing a handful of advanced features for v4.0, which will be released as a full project.  All the cmdlets and modules for it are complete; I'm just finishing up some C# code that will be wrapped in it, too.

## Version 3.0.3 ##

Minor processing adjustments have been made to clean-up some redundant or unnecessary code.

Improved the validity script for resolvable paths to ensure they meet the criteria required for the script to successfully run.

Added more detailed notes to further detail exactly what certain advanced functions and/or processes are doing.

Improved the Additional-Features function script in how it detected path types, added a few additional context menu additions and optimized some of the code that it generates for certain switches.

Cleaned up the help files and parameter/switch notes and information.

Changed the -AddFeatures switch to -AdditionalFeatures, as some were assuming the former switch was for adding features much like the -RemoveFeatures switch removes them.

## Version 3.0 ##

Version 3.0 has been released and includes some significant updates, changes and modifications.

The Helper-Script.ps1 has been removed.

There's a new function that allows for ownership of registry keys and subkeys to be granted to the BUILTIN\Administrator account, using Access Token privileges.

There are additional services and drivers disabled through the offline registry hives.

There are additional notes with some pertinent information regarding Provisioning Application Packages and Systep Applications.

Re-wrote the process where System Applications are "de-provisioned" and removed.

Added additional security registry settings.

The Additional-Features function script has been almost entirely re-written.

Now values are applied directly to the offline registry hives as opposed to using "REGEDIT /S" via OOBE.cmd

OOBE.cmd is now omitted, as it's no longer required with the elevated registry function.

The Windows 10 Enterprise LTSB 2016 Calculator (Win32Calc) is now able to be applied to the image. This is valuable if the regular calculator Provisioning Application Package is removed yet one still wants a built-in calculator.

A -SysPrep switch has been added that will auto-boot the image into Audit System for System Preparation.

A -GenuineTicket switch has been added that will apply a GenuineTicket.xml to the image for automatic activation upon installation.

And -Unattend switch has been added that will apply a custom unattend.xml to the image.

Generated scripts have been tweaked and modified to omit versions of Windows prior to Windows 10.

There's additional checking to ensure the build being optimized is supported (currently, there's no support for Insider Updates).
